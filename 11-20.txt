Group Profiles 11 - 20 (interest-based communities, in descending order of TAM size):

11. Photography Enthusiasts
  • Online Hubs: Photo hobbyists converge on sites like Flickr groups, DPReview forums (recently closed but migrated communities elsewhere), and Reddit’s r/photography (over 4M members). Facebook has groups such as “Photography 101” and countless camera brand-specific groups (Canon, Nikon users groups). Many older photographers also join local camera clubs (some have Facebook pages or Meetup groups). Platforms like Ugly Hedgehog (a forum skewing older photographers) are also popular.
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #11. Photography is a common hobby; about 20% of Americans consider photography a hobby ￼, roughly 50 million people. The advent of digital cameras saw many Boomers take it up in retirement. Enthusiasts range from casual smartphone snappers to serious amateurs with DSLR cameras. Middle-aged and retired individuals often invest in photography as a creative pursuit – this group has time and money for gear. It skews male historically (camera clubs were often majority men), but plenty of women are involved too (especially in nature and travel photography). Income tends to be moderate to high because camera equipment is expensive. Many enthusiasts are 40+, as younger folks often stick to phone photography while older might use dedicated cameras.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups: Nature/Wildlife photographers (many seniors in this category, traveling to national parks), Bird photographers (overlap with birding community), Street/travel photographers, Portrait photographers (could be semi-pro grandparents taking family photos), and camera gearheads who love the technical aspect. Some are loyal to brands (Canon vs Nikon folks – friendly rivalries exist). Preferences for apparel: camera-themed graphics (lens diagrams, aperture symbol), humorous slogans (“I Shoot RAW” – a famous photography pun referring to RAW image format), or lighthearted warnings (“Don’t mind me, I’m just focusing”). Some might like subtle designs only other photogs understand (inside jokes about bokeh, etc.).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Photographers often feel a strong identity as such and like to indicate their passion (e.g. wearing a shirt on a shoot or photo walk). The market is fairly large ￼ and intersects with travel and nature interests, offering multiple angles to design themes. Weaknesses – Many already get photo-themed apparel from camera companies (promos or events) or make custom shirts for their camera club. Also, those who treat it as art might not wear novelty shirts. Still, hobbyists with a sense of humor will. Marketing Ease – Moderate to High. They can be targeted by interest in camera brands or membership in online photo groups. Advertising on photography blogs, YouTube channels (gear review channels) could reach middle-aged hobbyists. There are also big trade shows (PhotoPlus, etc.) where a presence could build brand recognition.
  • Competitive Landscape: Some presence of camera brand merch (Canon, Nikon have official swag but it’s mostly hats/bags). Independent apparel with photography jokes exists on Etsy/Amazon – “I Shoot RAW” is common across many platforms. A few niche sites like Photography Tee exist but seem small. Overall, not a heavily saturated apparel niche compared to pets or sports. Many designs out there are generic. An entrant with creative, high-quality designs could attract enthusiasts looking for something beyond the cliché slogans.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Amateur Photographer Group” (100k+ members); Reddit: r/photography (~4M members), r/AskPhotography (300k members); Official-ish: “Ugly Hedgehog” Photography Forum (a site popular with older photographers, threads get thousands of views), local camera club Facebook pages (e.g. “Over 50s Photography Club”).

12. Cat Owners & Cat Lovers
  • Online Hubs: Huge presence on social media (cat memes rule the Internet). Facebook groups like “Crazy Cat Lady Society” (500k+ members) and “Cats, Cats, Cats!” are big. Reddit’s r/cats (4M+ members) is very active for sharing cat photos. Cat lovers also engage on Instagram and TikTok, though those skew younger. The community often intersects with rescue groups (many cat owners support shelters). There are also breed-specific forums (for Persian cat fanciers, etc.) and TheCatSite forum for general cat care.
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #12. About 42 million U.S. households have cats ￼, second only to dogs, which equates to roughly 50+ million individual cat owners. Cat ownership is common across ages, but interestingly, older adults often have cats for companionship (they can be easier than dogs for seniors). Stereotypically, cat lovers include many women, but plenty of men love cats too. Middle-aged women (the “cat mom” trope) are a key demographic, as are retired folks who might have multiple cats. Income varies widely; cats are generally less costly pets. The purchasing behavior tends to be strong on cat-themed items – the term “crazy cat lady” even implies collecting cat decor and apparel.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups include multiple-cat owners (proud “cat moms/dads” of several cats), specific breed enthusiasts (Siamese owners, Maine Coon lovers, etc.), funny cat meme fans (people who share cat humor constantly), and rescue/adoption advocates. Preferences: lots of humor and cute imagery. Popular themes are paw prints, cartoon cats, witty text (“I was normal 3 cats ago”). Women might like cute or artsy cat designs, while men often go for humorous (“Cat Father” as a parody of The Godfather, etc.). Also, subtle designs that only cat people get (like an outline of a cat sleeping) can be appealing for everyday wear.
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Cat owners often proudly embrace the “cat person” identity, sometimes even more vocally than dog owners (given the cultural memes). They love to showcase their affection – making cat-themed shirts, totes, mugs extremely popular. The TAM is very large ￼. The emotional factor is high; for many, cats are like children. Weaknesses – Similar to dogs, it’s an oversaturated market. Every gift shop has cat novelty items. Also, not all cat owners self-identify as “crazy cat people” – some may keep it low-key. But generally, the community is enthusiastic. Marketing Ease – High. Facebook and Instagram targeting of “cat interests” is straightforward (and typically yields large audiences). There’s also The Animal Rescue Site and other portals focused on cats where advertising could fit. Collaborations with cat influencers (yes, even older folks follow famous cats like Grumpy Cat’s legacy, etc.) could be a tactic.
  • Competitive Landscape: Heavy competition. Companies like Meowingtons specialize in cat-themed apparel and accessories ￼. Big e-commerce sites (Amazon, Chewy) sell tons of cat novelty shirts. The Animal Rescue Site Store sells cat lover clothing with proceeds to shelters ￼. Many Etsy sellers cater to niche cat humor. To compete, one could focus on better quality or unique, tasteful designs (some higher-end cat lovers merch exists, like subtle jewelry or artistic tees, but less so in mass market). Given the size of the community, there’s room for a strong brand that resonates with cat folks, despite the crowded field.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Cats, Cats, Cats!!!” (300k members); “Crazy Cat Ladies Unite” (120k members). Reddit: r/cats (~4M members) ￼. Official: TheCatSite forum (over 100k members). Also, countless rescue groups (e.g. “Black Cat Appreciation Society” 50k members) where cat lovers gather.

13. Fishing Enthusiasts
  • Online Hubs: Many older anglers swap tips on forums like BassResource (for bass fishing) or FlyFishingForum. Facebook groups are plentiful (e.g. “Fishing Junkies” with 100k members, regional groups for anglers in every state). Reddit’s r/fishing (~1M members) is active across ages. There are also communities via the app Fishbrain for sharing catches. State wildlife agencies often have online communities or Facebook pages where anglers comment.
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #13. Fishing is one of America’s favorite outdoor activities. In 2022, 39.9 million Americans (16+) went fishing ￼, and in 2023 roughly 57.7 million of all ages did (including youth) ￼. This indicates a huge participant base. Middle-aged and older men are a substantial portion – many grew up fishing and continue into retirement. There are also women anglers, though about 65-70% are male. Income varies: from rural folks fishing for leisure/food to affluent sport-fishermen with boats. Notably, fishing is popular across regions (especially Midwest, South, coastal areas) and is often a family tradition. Retirees often fish more frequently due to free time.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups by fishing type: Bass fishing folks (often very gear-oriented, possibly tournament participants), fly fishermen (a culture of its own, often older and willing to spend on gear and travel), saltwater anglers (deep-sea, coastal, might overlap with boating community), and casual weekend anglers. There are also those who fish primarily for relaxation at a local pond. Preferences: proud display of their angling style or favorite fish (shirts that say “Bass Master” or depict a largemouth bass). Humor is big (“Fishing solved most of my problems…beer solved the rest”). Patriotic themes sometimes merge (lots of American flag + fish designs in this space). Also, some like understated fishing lifestyle brands (like simply a fish hook graphic on a cap).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Fishing has a strong culture and identity – anglers often wear fishing caps, graphic tees, etc., especially on trips. The community is huge ￼, giving a broad market. Many anglers enjoy wearing gear that signals their hobby (even off the water). Weaknesses – The market is served in part by existing fishing/outdoor apparel brands (Columbia, Bass Pro) which are very popular for their functionality and logos. Convincing someone to buy a separate novelty shirt might depend on design appeal. Also, some older anglers just wear generic outdoor clothes and may not seek themed shirts unless given as gifts. Marketing Ease – High. Can target by interests (Bass Pro Shops shoppers, fishing TV shows, etc.) on social media. Also, direct partnerships with fishing blogs or YouTube fishing personalities could reach the right audience. Many Boomers read fishing magazines where ads could be placed. And local bait shop bulletin boards (for offline) is even an angle for grassroots marketing.
  • Competitive Landscape: Competitive, but often through outdoor brands: e.g. Bass Pro Shops/Cabela’s sells tons of fishing-themed apparel (both their own branded gear and novelty shirts by brands like Buck Wear which makes fishing/hunting humor tees). Salt Life is a popular brand in coastal areas for saltwater fishing lifestyle shirts. Niche brands like Fishizzle and Fishwear exist for stylish fishing tees. There’s also overlap with general outdoor apparel. To compete, one could focus on unique designs or underrepresented sub-niches (e.g. a line just for fly fishermen humor, which is smaller but not saturated). Quality (moisture-wicking tees with cool prints) might attract serious anglers more than a basic cotton tee.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Fishing Junkies” (115k members), “Fly Fishing Community” (40k members). Reddit: r/fishing (~1M members). Official: Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) has 500k+ members (mostly for news/tournaments), and local fishing club pages abound.

14. Genealogy & Family History Buffs
  • Online Hubs: Ancestry.com and similar genealogy websites are the heart of this community – Ancestry alone has 3+ million paying subscribers and many more free users. Their message boards and member connections form a community. Additionally, there are Facebook groups (e.g. “Genealogy Addicts” 30k members, surname or DNA interest groups). Reddit’s r/Genealogy (170k members) is active with people sharing research tips. Local historical societies and genealogy societies (like local chapters of the National Genealogical Society) often have online groups or email lists.
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #14. Genealogy has been cited as “the second most popular hobby in America after gardening” ￼ – while that may be anecdotal, it reflects its popularity, especially among older adults. Millions are actively researching family history. For instance, genealogy websites have tens of millions of users (Ancestry DNA has 25 million test takers). A realistic estimate of engaged hobbyists might be ~20–30 million. The demographic skews older; while interest in DNA has attracted some younger users, the core genealogists are often retirees who finally have time to dig into archives. It’s roughly equal gender (perhaps slightly more female in genealogy circles). Many have at least moderate income due to subscription costs for databases and travel to ancestral locations.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups include DNA enthusiasts (people heavily into DNA matches and genetic genealogy), family tree builders who focus on collecting names and stories, single-surname researchers (tracing one lineage deep), and history buffs focusing on ancestral contexts (overlap with history interest). There are also heritage groups (e.g. Italian-Americans researching Italian roots). Preferences for merch: genealogists love quirky sayings like “I seek dead people” (a famous genealogy t-shirt slogan) or “Genealogist – solving mysteries one ancestor at a time.” They might also appreciate things with family tree graphics or DNA helix images. Humor often revolves around the addiction of genealogy or the thrill of breaking through a “brick wall” (tough research problem).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – This community, especially retirees, often proudly identify as family historians. They attend genealogy conferences and society meetings where wearing a fun shirt could spark conversation. It’s a niche that isn’t overserved with merchandise, so enthusiasts often find the few novelty items available and wear them. Emotional resonance is high – it ties into family pride and heritage. Weaknesses – It’s somewhat niche in that not every casual Ancestry user wants a genealogy shirt; it’s more the die-hards. Also, some might prefer more dignified expressions of heritage (like a custom family crest shirt rather than a joke). Marketing Ease – Moderate. They can be targeted through genealogy site ads (Ancestry or FamilySearch could be advertising platforms) and Facebook interest in genealogy/dna testing. Many read genealogy blogs or YouTube channels (like Ancestry’s own content, or “GeneaBloggers”). Also, genealogy societies have newsletters that might accept adverts.
  • Competitive Landscape: Minimal mainstream competition. Some shirts are sold at genealogy conferences and by small online sellers (e.g. CafePress has “I seek dead people” shirts widely available). There isn’t a dedicated large retailer for genealogy apparel. This means an entrant could become the brand for genealogists fairly easily. One challenge: personalization (some want their family name on a shirt) but that can be separate from general witty designs. Overall, a fairly open field with mostly low-volume Etsy/CafePress presence.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Genealogy Addicts” (32k members); “Genealogy – Tips and Tricks” (50k members). Reddit: r/Genealogy (~170k members). Official: Ancestry.com’s community forums; National Genealogical Society member forums. Plus many local genealogy society Facebook groups with a few thousand each.

15. Classic Car Enthusiasts & Vintage Auto Collectors
  • Online Hubs: Classic car fans gather at forums like Hemmings, ClassicCars.com forum, and many model-specific clubs (Mustang Club, Antique Automobile Club of America forum). Facebook has groups such as “Classic Car Enthusiasts” (100k+ members) and innumerable groups for specific makes/eras (e.g. “1950s Chevy Owners”). They also congregate in person at car shows and on related YouTube channels (Jay Leno’s Garage community, etc.).
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #15. The collector car community is sizable. Around 43 million vehicles in the U.S. qualify as “collector” cars (per Hagerty) ￼ – implying perhaps tens of millions of owners or fans (many own more than one). Not everyone with an old car is active in the community, but those who are likely number in the millions. Demographically, the majority are men over 45. Classic car owners are often Boomers and older Gen X; a survey shows most are 55–64 years old (25%) or 65+ (25%) ￼, and about 80% male ￼. Income skews higher since collecting/restoring cars is expensive; many have $50k–150k household income or more ￼. It’s also regionally popular in suburbs and rural areas with space for garages.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups by era or type: Muscle car enthusiasts (60s–70s American performance cars – a big Boomer passion), antique car collectors (pre-war cars, Model T etc., often older collectors), classic truck enthusiasts, and hot rod customizers. There are also cruiser culture folks (drive-ins, 1950s nostalgia). Preferences in apparel: club-style shirts or hats with their specific car model (e.g. Corvette Club jackets). Also general slogans like “Classic Car Club – Old School Horsepower.” Many like retro aesthetics – vintage logos, pin-up girl art, etc., reminiscent of the era their cars are from. Pride in their vehicle is key (e.g. wearing a shirt with an image of a ’57 Chevy if they own one).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Enthusiasts are very proud of their hobby and love to show it. They frequently wear car-themed apparel at shows and meetups. Car shows often sell a lot of merch. Also, family members gift them related shirts (“Still Plays with Cars” is a popular slogan on Boomer shirts). Weaknesses – Many already have extensive merch collections from specific car clubs or events (every big car show sells t-shirts). Brand licensing can be an issue if using car images or logos (need to avoid trademarks like Ford logo, etc.). But focusing on generic classic car imagery or clever text avoids that. Marketing Ease – High within channels: advertise on Hemmings.com or classic car Facebook pages. These enthusiasts consume media like Hemmings Motor News, classic car TV shows, etc. An older demographic, but quite online (forums, eBay for parts, etc.). Also, attending car events with a booth could directly reach thousands of target customers.
  • Competitive Landscape: A lot of event-specific and club-specific apparel (e.g. the annual Car Nationals shirt). Brands like Holley and Edelbrock (auto parts companies) have lifestyle apparel that enthusiasts wear. But in terms of independent apparel focusing on classic car pride, it’s mostly small vendors. Old Guys Rule is a notable apparel brand that targets older men with hobbies including classic cars (they have shirts like “Vintage Iron” with old car graphics) – they’ve gained traction in gift shops ￼. Other than that, competition is fragmented by make (e.g. Corvette store, Mustang merch). An all-encompassing classic car enthusiast brand could unify the market if done well, though must navigate trademarks carefully (use art and humor rather than specific car names).
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Classic Car Enthusiasts” (120k members); “Classic Muscle Cars” (200k members). Forums: AACA Forums (~50k members); Reddit’s r/classiccars (50k members). Official: Hemmings Nation (Hemmings’ community), numerous local car clubs (each often with 100–1000 members).

16. DIY Woodworking & Home Workshop Hobbyists
  • Online Hubs: Woodworkers gather on forums like LumberJocks, Sawmill Creek, and Reddit’s r/woodworking (over 4.5M members, though many are younger DIYers too). Facebook has groups like “Woodworking for Beginners” (300k members) and “Woodworkers Guild” etc. Many follow YouTube creators who do woodworking projects (and those channels have communities of largely middle-aged hobbyists). There are also local woodworking clubs and classes (sometimes with Facebook pages).
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #16. DIY woodworking is a substantial hobby segment. An estimated 26% of Americans engage in DIY crafts/woodworking ￼, and one industry stat puts “active creatives” (including woodworkers) at ~85 million in US & Canada ￼. Serious woodworking hobbyists likely number in the low millions. This hobby skews male and 40+, as it requires space (often a garage or shop) and tools accumulated over time. Many retirees take up woodworking for fun or to make furniture for family. Income must be enough to afford tools; many are middle-class homeowners.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups include furniture makers (building tables, cabinets), woodturners (lathe work, bowls), carvers, and general DIYers who build misc. home projects. Some overlap with home improvement DIY (building a deck, etc.). Preferences: humor about sawdust and tools (“I turn wood into things, what’s your superpower?”), pride in craftsmanship (“Measure Twice, Cut Once” classic phrase). Also references to favorite wood species or tools (some shirts say “Still plays with blocks” with woodblocks image). Many woodworkers appreciate subtle nods (a graphic of crossed saws, etc.) that fellow hobbyists recognize.
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Woodworkers have a bit of a fraternity; they love to share their projects and wear shirts/hats that identify their passion. Often, their families gift them related tees on Father’s Day, etc. They also attend woodworking shows/fairs where merch is sold. Weaknesses – It’s somewhat niche compared to giant hobbies like cooking; not every DIYer wants to wear a shirt about it. And some might just wear generic work clothes when woodworking (so apparel is more for off-duty pride). Marketing Ease – Moderate. Targeting by interest online (e.g. fans of woodworking pages, tools brands like “Woodcraft” or “Rockler”) can isolate this group. Also, tool companies’ social media (like DeWalt or Makita) have many middle-aged followers who are into DIY. Traditional channels: ads in woodworking magazines (Popular Woodworking) could hit the right audience directly.
  • Competitive Landscape: Fairly small-scale. A few novelty shirts appear via woodworking retailers (Rockler and Woodcraft stores sometimes sell a funny tee or two). Etsy has many print-on-demand shirts with woodworking puns. No major apparel brand focuses solely on this. Some tool brands produce logo apparel which woodworkers wear, but that’s more branding than hobby expression. This niche is an opportunity for a dedicated line of witty/cool designs because currently enthusiasts often resort to generic online shirt sites.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Woodworking for Beginners” (320k members); “Weekend Woodworkers” (50k). Reddit: r/woodworking (~4.5M members). Official: LumberJocks.com (600k+ project posts, tens of thousands of users), American Association of Woodturners (16k members, with local chapters).

17. RV Camping & Road Travel Enthusiasts
  • Online Hubs: The RV community thrives on forums like iRV2 and RV.net. Facebook has “RV Living” (200k members) and “RV Camping” type groups. There’s also a strong YouTube presence (channels about full-time RV living). Clubs like Good Sam (which has ~2 million members) have forums and Facebook pages. Escapees RV Club (for full-timers) also provides online communities.
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #17. RV ownership is significant: about 11.2 million U.S. households own an RV ￼, and many more rent or aspire to. Owners’ median age is about 55 ￼, though it’s dropping slightly as younger families buy in. Still, retirees are a huge segment (many hit the road after 65). Income: average around $62k/year for owners ￼ – middle-class. The community also includes full-timers (often retirees who sold their home) and weekenders (middle-aged people vacationing). In total, including those who regularly camp with RVs, the enthusiast base might be 15–20 million people.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups: Full-time RVers (often 60s, living in motorhomes or fifth-wheels year-round), Seasonal snowbirds (northern retirees wintering in the south via RV), Campers/Weekend warriors (families or couples going out occasionally). Preferences: lots of fun slogans about the freedom of the open road (“Home is where you park it” is a very popular phrase) and pride in their rig (“RV There Yet?”). Many like graphics of campers or campfires. There’s also a division between motorhome folks and trailer folks, but generally “camping” themes unite them. Some lean into the retro camper aesthetic (50s camper image with “Happy Camper” text).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – RVers form a strong community identity, especially full-timers who even call it a “lifestyle.” They often decorate their RVs with witty signs and wear campground t-shirts. Thematically appropriate apparel (comfortable tees for travel days with slogans) would be attractive. The market is sizeable with millions of enthusiasts ￼. Weaknesses – Many campgrounds and RV rallies give out shirts or sell branded merch, so enthusiasts may already have a few. Also, designs need to appeal to an older audience and be legible/fun rather than very edgy. Marketing Ease – High. Target through Good Sam Club or Escapees newsletters. Facebook targeting is easy (interest in Camping World, RV brands). They also attend large RV shows (opportunity for direct selling). AARP might also overlap since RV travel is popular among their membership.
  • Competitive Landscape: There’s a moderate amount of existing merch: Life is Good has an RV collection of t-shirts ￼. Camping World (major retailer) sells clothing with camping motifs. Numerous Etsy sellers do “Happy Camper” shirts. However, aside from Life is Good, few mainstream brands focus on RVers specifically. It’s mostly generic camping slogans repeated by many vendors. A brand dedicated to the RV life could differentiate with fresh designs (perhaps specific to motorhome vs trailer, or humorous takes on road life beyond the standard phrases).
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “RV Living” (210k members); “Full Time RV” (125k members). Forums: iRV2.com (500k posts, very active); Escapees discussion forum (a leading club for full-timers). Official: Good Sam Club (1.8M members, forums on their site), FMCA (Family Motor Coach Association, 150k members mostly retirees).

18. Cruise Travelers & Cruise Enthusiasts
  • Online Hubs: The go-to is Cruise Critic – a massive forum with sub-communities for every cruise line (millions of posts). Facebook has groups like “Cruise Addicts” (100k members) and many cruise line-specific fan groups (e.g. “Royal Caribbean Enthusiasts”). Reddit’s r/Cruise (150k members) exists but Cruise Critic is far larger for this demographic. People also form Roll Call groups (meet-ups for specific cruise sailings via Cruise Critic or FB).
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #18. Cruising is very popular among older demographics. In 2024, about 18.2 million Americans took an ocean cruise ￼ (post-pandemic boom). Pre-2020, ~14 million North Americans cruised annually, and now it’s hitting record highs ￼. The average age of cruise travelers has traditionally been around mid-50s ￼, though it’s edging down to mid-40s recently. Still, a huge portion are retirees or near-retirees. Many cruise enthusiasts take multiple trips a year. Income: varies but generally middle-class and above (cruises can be affordable or luxury). The core “cruise fanatics” often are empty nest Boomers who have the time and money.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups: Cruise line loyalists (people who are mega-fans of a particular line like Carnival vs Royal Caribbean vs Holland America – they often identify with the brand’s culture), Frequent cruisers (members of cruise loyalty programs, sometimes humorously called “cruise addicts”), Theme cruisers (who go on music or interest-themed cruises, but those are niche). Preferences: Many cruisers already buy ship-specific merch onboard (hats, etc.), but also like clever shirts for group cruises (“Best Cruise Ever 2025”). Popular sayings in this community: “Sea Ya Later,” “Gone Cruisin’”. Family reunion cruise groups often print matching shirts. Also jokes about the cruise lifestyle (“Will work for cruise money”, “Floating retirement home” playfully).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Cruisers are very enthusiastic. They often travel in groups or meet new friends onboard, and custom t-shirts for those groups are popular. The anticipation and memory of cruising means they enjoy related swag year-round (to declare their love of the sea). Weaknesses – Cruise lines themselves sell a lot of branded merchandise, which can satiate the desire unless a design is uniquely appealing. Also, some might only wear cruise shirts during a cruise or at home when feeling nostalgic, not as everyday wear. But many do incorporate it casually. Marketing Ease – High. Cruise Critic has advertising opportunities and a huge audience of exactly this demo. Facebook targeting by interest in cruising or specific cruise lines is precise. Also, working with travel agents or cruise vloggers who have Boomer followers could help. Notably, the word “cruise” must be used carefully in marketing to avoid confusion with cruise line official merch.
  • Competitive Landscape: There’s informal competition: a lot of people use custom print shops to make their own cruise group shirts (e.g. matching family cruise tees). Online, numerous Etsy sellers target cruise-goers with those aforementioned slogans. But no major apparel label is dedicated to cruise enthusiasts. Most buy either the official line’s merch or generic cruise shirts from Amazon/Etsy. This is an opportunity to build a brand that cruise lovers recognize. Possibly the biggest competition is the onboard gift shop (for instance, Princess Cruises sells “Captain’s Circle” shirts to loyalty members). But those are line-specific and not humorous.
  • Online Group Links: Cruise Critic: (Community of millions; e.g. 1M+ posts in Royal Caribbean forum). Facebook: “Cruising Addicts” (100k members); “55+ Cruisers” (20k members). Reddit: r/Cruise (~150k). Official: Many cruise lines have past-passenger clubs with forums (Carnival’s VIFP club groups, etc.).

19. Arts & Crafts (Knitting, Quilting, Sewing)
  • Online Hubs: Crafters are all over Facebook and specialized forums. For knitting/crochet, Ravelry.com is a huge platform with millions of users sharing patterns (skews female 50+). Facebook groups like “Addicted to Knitting” (200k members) and countless quilting groups exist. Reddit’s r/knitting (500k members) and r/quilting (100k) are active. There are also quilting forum sites (e.g. Quilting Board).
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #19. The crafting segment is enormous: an AFCI study found 62% of U.S. households participate in at least one crafting hobby ￼. Narrowing to fiber arts: 28.8 million Americans knit or crochet ￼ (2016 data). Quilting has about 7-10 million enthusiasts (Quilting in America survey). The majority are women, often middle-aged or older. For example, almost half of dedicated yarn crafters are retired ￼. Sewing is also common among older women. Income varies; many are thrifty but collectively it’s a multi-billion dollar market in supplies. This group has strong representation among Boomers (many learned these skills young and continue for enjoyment or charity work).
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups: Knitters vs Crocheters (friendly rivalry but lots of overlap), Quilters (big subculture – guilds, quilt shows), Sewists (garment sewing or embroidery), and general DIY crafters. They often have separate communities, though some do multiple crafts. Preferences: Yarn crafters love sheep or yarn ball imagery, funny sayings (“I knit so I don’t kill people” – a popular tongue-in-cheek shirt). Quilters enjoy slogans about quilting being cheaper than therapy (debatable!) or showcasing patchwork designs. Many of these slogans already circulate on tote bags and mugs. Aesthetic can be whimsical or vintage (especially for quilters who often like a homespun feel). Also pride in the patience and skill (“I turn string into blankets, what’s your superpower?”).
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Crafters, particularly quilters and knitters, often form tight-knit (no pun intended) social circles (stitch ‘n bitch groups, quilt guilds). They frequently make or buy novelty items reflecting their passion. For example, quilt guild members often wear matching shirts on retreats. The large numbers ￼ indicate a big market, and gifting within this community is common (they gift each other crafty mugs, shirts, etc.). Weaknesses – Some prefer to literally wear their craft (like a handmade sweater) rather than a t-shirt about it. Also, aesthetic tastes can vary widely (from loud and proud “crazy craft lady” to more subtle). But generally, there’s an appetite for fun merchandise. Marketing Ease – High within niche channels. You can target by interest in Michaels/JoAnn stores on Facebook, or via Ravelry ads (they allow some ads and reach millions of yarn crafters globally). Also, craft fairs and quilt shows often have vendors selling t-shirts, showing proven demand offline.
  • Competitive Landscape: There’s moderate competition. Some indie brands cater to knitters (e.g. Stitched by JessaLu for bags, a few do shirts). Big craft chains sell some novelty shirts (JoAnn had “I could stop buying yarn but I’m not a quitter” tees seasonally). Many designs are on CafePress/Redbubble uploaded by individuals. The market is fragmented; no dominant apparel brand for all crafters, though Etsy is flooded with options. A unified brand for craft hobby apparel could gain loyalty if it covers multiple crafts with quality designs.
  • Online Group Links: Facebook: “Addicted to Knitting” (230k members), “Quilting” (90k members). Forums: Ravelry (8+ million registered knit/crochet users globally), QuiltingBoard.com (over 100k members). Reddit: r/knitting (~500k), r/quilting (~115k). Official: The Knitting Guild Association (TKGA) and local quilt guilds (thousands of members) often have social pages.

20. Cigar Aficionados
  • Online Hubs: Cigar lovers socialize on forums like CigarDojo or Reddit’s r/cigars (180k members). There are also private Facebook groups (often secret/invite-only due to tobacco rules, but examples include “Cigar Cartel” with tens of thousands of members). Cigar aficionados follow publications like Cigar Aficionado (which has online forums/comments) and gather at local cigar lounges (some lounges have FB pages/groups for regulars).
  • Size & Demographics: TAM Rank #20. About 17.4 million U.S. adults smoke cigars at least occasionally ￼ (7.3% of adults). The core aficionado community (those who buy premium hand-rolled cigars, attend cigar events, etc.) is smaller – perhaps a few million devoted enthusiasts. Demographically, over a third of premium cigar smokers are 55 or older ￼, and the vast majority (~90%) are male. Income skews higher as premium cigars are not cheap; many aficionados are professionals or retirees with disposable income. This group often overlaps with veterans or business networking circles. They value the leisure and camaraderie aspect of cigar smoking.
  • Subgroups & Preferences: Subgroups: Lounge regulars (folks who hang out at cigar bars weekly), collectors (aging cigars in humidors, chasing rare limited editions), and casual social smokers. Some identify by taste for certain regions (Cuban cigar fans vs Nicaraguan, etc.). Preferences in apparel: Often military or classic macho undertones (since many cigar clubs have veteran presence). Common themes: “Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar” (famous quote), or playful bad-boy vibes (“Support Cohiba Habit”). Also, a lot of cigar merch references luxury or relaxation (e.g. pairing with whiskey). Imagery of cigars, smoke, or pairing spirits might be popular.
  • Merchandise Potential: Strengths – Aficionados are proud of their hobby (which is somewhat niche and distinguished). They often wear cigar club shirts or hats, especially at cigar events or lounges. There’s a fraternal feel, so apparel with a cigar club look can appeal. Weaknesses – The pool of enthusiasts is moderate, and tobacco-related merchandise can’t be advertised freely on some platforms due to ad policies. Also, cigar smokers might lean towards accessories (like lighters, cutters) more than clothing, though many do enjoy shirts. Marketing Ease – Moderate. Facebook/Instagram have restrictions on tobacco promotion, so targeting has to be interest-based but careful. Forums and cigar magazine ads might be the way to go (Cigar Aficionado magazine or websites allow advertising of accessories which likely includes apparel). Many cigar lovers are reached via email newsletters from cigar retailers, which could host ads. Networking through cigar lounges or sponsoring cigar events could also work.
  • Competitive Landscape: Cigar brands themselves sell a lot of logo apparel (e.g. big brands like Montecristo, Arturo Fuente have hats/shirts given out or sold to fans). Also, general “smoking” humor shirts exist online. A brand called Cigars International sells some generic “I love cigars” apparel in their online store ￼. But outside of brand logos, not many dedicated apparel lines for cigar hobbyists. This is somewhat a niche within a niche. If entering, one might collaborate with known cigar influencers or create designs classy enough that lounges might carry them. Competition is relatively low except for cigar brand swag.
  • Online Group Links: Forums: r/cigars on Reddit (~180k members) with active discussions; CigarDojo forum/app (popular among 30k+ aficionados). Facebook: “Cigar Life” group (private, ~40k members). Official-ish: Cigar Aficionado magazine community (its Facebook page has 200k followers; their events like Big Smoke attract thousands). Local cigar lounge groups (each may have a few hundred members).
